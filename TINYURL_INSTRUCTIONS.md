Create a short public link (TinyURL)

1) Open TinyURL in your browser: https://tinyurl.com
2) Paste your Render public URL, for example: `https://simple-order-backend.onrender.com`
3) (Optional) Click "Customize" and choose a short slug like `IITKGPCABS` if available. If the custom slug is taken, choose another.
4) Click "Shorten" and copy the generated short link, e.g. `https://tinyurl.com/IITKGPCABS`.
5) Share the short link with customers. It redirects to your Render URL.

Notes:
- TinyURL free links are public and simple. For a custom branded domain you would need a paid plan or DNS setup.
- Test the short link on your phone's browser to confirm it opens the app.
